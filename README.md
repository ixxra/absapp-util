#Abstraction & Application Utilites

This repository contains utility tools for the [online magazine](http://intranet.matematicas.uady.mx/journal/) of Autonomous University of Yucatan.

##About

*Abstraction and Application* is moving away from its current format to a more open and accessible website.

Given the fluidity of html5 and the solid background of [open journal system](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/), we aim to offer a more modern and easy to navigate and read online journal.

Most of the tools here are crafted as needed. Enqueries about the repository or journal are welcome.
